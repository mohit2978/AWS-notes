S3 is global buckets are regional!!
 
 By default s3 buckets are private ,even public buckets objects are still private !!

> By default versioning is not enabled

> ACL (Access Control list)

When setting up Elastic Bean Stalk , you have created s3 bucket too , to store environment variable!!

To delete this bucket ,go inside bucket then permissions there you first need to delete the bucket policy then only you will be able to delete the bucket created 
by beanstallk, but first empty the bucket!!

let us create bucket , bucket name is universal so create something and put AccountId
at last so that bucket name can be unique!!

private bucket ACLs disabled!!ACLs disabled only IAM policy can be used to access bucket!!

public bucket ACLs enabled--> Objects in this bucket can be owned by other AWS accounts. Access to this bucket and its objects can be specified using ACLs.

we choose disabled for now!!Recommended one is always private bucket!!

then comes Block Public Access settings for this bucket!as private bucket so do not uncheck it!!
> Note:if uncheck it then it will be public bucket!!

for public bucket ACLs enabled!! Bucket versioning disabled for now!!

for now we disable it , then create bucket!!

If you enable it object will be locked in bucket!!

To create public bucket!! ACLs enabled!! Object Ownership needs to be decided recommended bucket ownner as object ownner ,uncheck Block public access and acknowledge it!!

in s3 you have 2 types of buckets

1. general purpos bucket
2. directory bucket(latest) (super fast ,low latency , single digit ms latency)(billable)

only diffenence between two is directory bucket has single digit ms latency ,it is just very fast!!

so now we created two bucket private and public

In objects we upload all the objects!!

>Note:To upload object >160 Gb you need to upload via CLI and do multi part upload via CLI,rest api or SDKs

On upload only you see bucket URL and then you see permissiosions,as we have opened private bucket so permissions can only be given by IAM policies!!
