S3 is global buckets are regional!!
 
 By default s3 buckets are private ,even public buckets objects are still private !!

> By default versioning is not enabled

> ACL (Access Control list)

When setting up Elastic Bean Stalk , you have created s3 bucket too , to store environment variable!!

To delete this bucket , you first need to delete the bucket policy then only you will be able to delete the bucket created 
by beanstallk, but first empty the bucket!!
